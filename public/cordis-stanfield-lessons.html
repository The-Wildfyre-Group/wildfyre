						<h3>&#8220; So much of life is self-esteem... &#8221;</h3>
						<blockquote>I was in Dallas, TX in a beyond beat up infinity that literally felt like it was coughing
						when my Cousin said this to me. He had no money, his car was beyond beat up, no girl, but his walk was still strong and his confidence to right all of his
						wrongs on 100.

						<h3>&#8220; You ain't had no problems till you had crack cocaine problems... &#8221;</h3>
						<blockquote>I was in the car half-listening to NPR. They were recounting the story of how someone had
						been killed in a pool. I'm it was significant but had already missed the important parts. They moved to interviews supposedly talking about where it all went wrong and..
						Be blessed. Especially if you are fortunate enough to have uptown problems. The problems of the world will rarely confront you unless you seek them out. People are hungry, at war,
						completely impoverished, uneducated, and there are no clinics to check into. What "problems" do you really have?
